## 📋 Basic Information

- **Name:** KBMasterToken
- **Symbol:** KBMT
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Total Supply:** 10,000,000 KBMT (immutable)
- **Standard:** ERC-20
- **Solidity Version:** ^0.8.19

## 🎯 Contract Purpose

KBMasterToken is a fully decentralized ERC-20 token designed with maximum security and absence of central control in mind. The contract eliminates possibilities of manipulation by administrators, guaranteeing fixed token supply and enabling complete decentralization.

### Key Features:

- **Immutable Variables**: After deployment, variables such as `totalSupply` are immutable.
- **No Administrative Functions**: No variables such as `owner` or administrative privileges.
- **No mint/burn**: Impossibility of minting or burning tokens.
- **Decentralized Distribution**: Tokens are distributed in a decentralized manner, with 1% for deployer and 99% stored in contract.

## 📊 Token Distribution

| Address      | Percentage | Token Amount | Description                |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Deployer** | 1%         | 100,000 KBMT | Minimal amount for creator |
| **Contract** | 99%        | 9,900,000 KBMT | Available for community  |

## 🔧 Contract Functions

### Standard ERC-20 Functions

#### `balanceOf(address account) → uint256`
Returns the token balance of a specific account.

#### `transfer(address to, uint256 amount) → bool`
Transfers tokens from sender's account to recipient.

#### `approve(address spender, uint256 amount) → bool`
Allows another address to spend a specified amount of tokens from owner's account.

#### `allowance(address owner, address spender) → uint256`
Checks how many tokens the `spender` address can spend from owner's account.

#### `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) → bool`
Transfers tokens between accounts. Requires prior approval from account owner.

### Additional Security Functions

#### `increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) → bool`
Increases allowance by a specified value, ensuring security in operations.

#### `decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) → bool`
Decreases allowance by a specified value, protecting against accidental limit overflow.

### Contract-Related Functions

#### `getContractBalance() → uint256`
Returns the amount of tokens stored in the contract.

#### `withdrawFromContract(address to, uint256 amount) → bool`
Allows any user to withdraw tokens from the contract. **No restrictions** – full decentralization.

#### `checkContractBalance() → uint256`
Checks contract balance and emits event informing about the state.

#### `getTokenInfo() → (string, string, uint8, uint256)`
Returns basic token information: name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.

#### `isSecureContract() → bool`
Confirms that the contract meets high security standards.

## 📡 Events

### Standard ERC-20 Events
- `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`
- `Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)`

### Additional Events
- `TokensDeployed(address indexed deployer, uint256 totalSupply)`
- `TokensWithdrawn(address indexed to, uint256 amount)`
- `ContractBalanceChecked(uint256 balance)`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Constructor Parameters
The constructor requires no parameters.

### After Deployment:
- Deployer receives: 100,000 KBMT (1% of supply)
- Contract stores: 9,900,000 KBMT (99% of supply)

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Check Account Balance

```solidity
uint256 balance = token.balanceOf(userAddress);
```

### Transfer Tokens

```solidity
token.transfer(recipientAddress, 1000 * 10**18); // 1000 KBMT
```

### Withdraw from Contract

```solidity
token.withdrawFromContract(myAddress, 500 * 10**18); // 500 KBMT
```

### Check Contract Balance

```solidity
uint256 contractTokens = token.getContractBalance();
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Rug Pull Protection
Due to the absence of administrative privileges and the fact that the deployer owns only 1% of tokens, the contract is resistant to rug pulls. All remaining tokens (99%) are stored in the contract, ensuring full decentralization and transparency. No single account can control the total supply.

### No Supply Manipulation Possibility
TotalSupply is immutable, no mint/burn functions exist.

### Decentralized Access
Anyone can withdraw tokens from the contract without restrictions.

### Transparency
Code is open, and all operations are monitored through events.

## 💻 Integration Guide

### 🔌 Contract Interaction:

```javascript
// Web3.js example
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Check contract balance
const contractBalance = await contract.methods.getContractBalance().call();

// Withdraw tokens
await contract.methods.withdrawFromContract(userAddress, amount).send({from: userAddress});

// Get token info
const tokenInfo = await contract.methods.getTokenInfo().call();
```

### 📱 Frontend Integration:
